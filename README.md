# TensorFlow Developer Certificate Material

This repo contains the material that I made while studying for the TensorFlow Developer certification, which covers everything given in the [Coursera Tensorflow Developer Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice) and adds a Multi-Variate Time Series Forecasting notebook. I hope you enjoy the content and find it useful.
